# Network Protocol Downgrade Detector

Work in Progress

The Network Protocol Downgrade Detector is an Android application developed using Android Studio and Kotlin. Its primary objective is to assist users in identifying the presence of an attack by state or non-state actors utilizing stingrays or cell-site simulators. 

## Current status
- App monitors network protocol, location, signal strength, battery status

## What's next
- Figure out alert logic (for example, should an alert only be raised when the phone's network protocol is downgraded in tandem with an unexpected location change and drop in battery life)
