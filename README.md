# Network Protocol Downgrade Detector

Work in Progress

The Network Protocol Downgrade Detector is an Android application developed using Android Studio and Kotlin. Its primary objective is to assist users in identifying instances where their mobile devices shift from secure network protocols to less secure protocols. This change in protocols could potentially indicate the presence of an attack by state actors utilizing stingrays or cell-site simulators.

## Features

- Monitors the network protocol status of the user's device.
- Alerts the user when a downgrade from a more secure protocol (e.g., 4G+) to a less secure protocol (e.g., 3G, 2G) is detected.
- Provides real-time notifications to keep the user informed about the status of their network connection.
